### Hi there üòÅ


My name is **Xiang Gao | È´òÁøî**.



I‚Äôm a first year Master student at the University of California San Diego ([UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/)), focusing on [Signal and Image Processing](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/faculty-research/ece-research-areas/signal-image-processing) and Machine Learning. I am also a research assistant advised by [Prof. Xinyu Zhang](http://xyzhang.ucsd.edu/).

I earned my bachelor's degree in communication engineering with honors from Tianjin University in 4 years in 2022. I was a research assistant advised by Professor [Yuan Zhou](https://seea.tju.edu.cn/info/1015/1605.htm) during my undergraduate study. After graduation, I worked as a full-time 4G/5G Integration & Verification Engineer in [ERICSSON](https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/company-facts/ericsson-worldwide/china).
